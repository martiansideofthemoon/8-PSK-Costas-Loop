# 8 PSK Costas Loop

This is a python implementation of an 8-PSK Costas Loop made as on [OOT Module](https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/OutOfTreeModules) for [GNURadio](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio). It can work as a standalone python script as well.

The project builds two GNURadio blocks, an 8-PSK threshold block to carry out phase detection along with a complete working Costas Loop (which uses the threshold code).

## Installation Instructions

* Make sure you have `cmake`, `numpy` and `gnuradio` installed.
* Clone the repository, `git clone https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon/8-PSK-Costas-Loop`.
